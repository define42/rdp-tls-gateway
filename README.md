# RDP-TLS-Gateway

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/define42/rdp-tls-gateway/graph/badge.svg?token=HS2KD8YHNG)](https://codecov.io/gh/define42/rdp-tls-gateway)

`rdp-tls-gateway` is a self-hosted gateway that publishes libvirt-managed virtual
desktops over a single HTTPS port. It combines three things on TCP `:443`:

1. An **RDP-over-TLS reverse proxy** that terminates TLS from the client, picks
   a backend VM based on the client's TLS SNI, and re-establishes TLS to that
   backend. The proxy speaks raw RDP (X.224 / TPKT), not the Microsoft RD
   Gateway HTTP/UDP transports.
2. An **HTTPS web dashboard** for end users to create, start, stop, restart and
   delete their own virtual machines, download an `.rdp` connection file, and
   open an in-browser serial console or noVNC session.
3. **LDAP-backed authentication** so the same credentials gate both the
   dashboard and any RDP session that traverses the gateway.

Connections are demultiplexed by sniffing the first byte on the accepted TCP
socket: a TLS handshake record (`0x16`) is routed to the HTTPS handler, anything
else is treated as an RDP X.224 Connection Request.

> ⚠️ This is **not** Microsoft RD Gateway. It is a TLS-to-TLS RDP proxy plus a
> companion management UI. There is no HTTP- or UDP-tunneled RDP transport.

## Features

- **RDP-over-TLS reverse proxy** with SNI-based backend routing.
- **HTTPS dashboard** for self-service VM lifecycle management (create, start,
  restart, shutdown, remove, resize CPU/RAM).
- **In-browser consoles**: serial console and noVNC streamed over WebSocket.
- **LDAP authentication** with optional StartTLS and optional certificate
  verification.
- **ACME / Let's Encrypt** support for automatic public TLS certificates, with
  a self-signed fallback for local development.
- **Per-session RDP hardening**: optionally strip the `cliprdr` (clipboard) and
  `rdpdr` (drive/printer/smart-card redirection) static virtual channels from
  every proxied session, regardless of client or VM Group Policy.
- **Libvirt integration** for managing QEMU/KVM virtual machines from a
  configurable storage pool, with base image auto-download.
- **Single port** (`:443`) for everything: dashboard, websockets, and RDP.

```

The RDP flow on the front side is:

1. Read the client's X.224 Connection Request (TPKT).
2. Reply with an X.224 Connection Confirm selecting `PROTOCOL_SSL` (TLS).
3. Complete the TLS handshake with the client and read SNI.
4. TCP-connect to the chosen backend.
5. Send a fresh Connection Request to the backend requesting TLS only.
6. Read the backend's Connection Confirm and require `PROTOCOL_SSL`.
7. Complete the backend TLS handshake (backend cert verification is skipped).
8. Splice bytes between client TLS and backend TLS for the rest of the session.

## Quick start (Docker Compose)

Requirements on the host:

- Docker and Docker Compose v2.
- A libvirt daemon reachable at `/var/run/libvirt` (the compose file
  bind-mounts it into the gateway container).
- A `virbr0` bridge for the macvlan network (the default libvirt NAT bridge).
- Write access to `/data/` on the host (used for ACME data, VM images, and
  serial / VNC sockets).

Start the stack:

```sh
make run
```

This stops any previous stack, rebuilds the images, and starts:

- `gateway` — the Go binary, listening on `https://localhost` (port `443`).
- `ldap` — a `glauth/glauth` LDAP server pre-populated from
  `testldap/default-config.cfg` for local development.

To stop everything: `docker compose stop`.

## Login flow

Open `https://localhost` in a browser. If the gateway generated a self-signed
certificate (the default for local runs without `CERT_FILE` / `KEY_FILE`), the
browser will warn — choose **Advanced** → **Proceed to localhost (unsafe)**.

Sign in with the seeded test account:

- username: `johndoe`
- password: `dogood`

A successful login redirects to `/api/dashboard`, where you can:

- Create a new VM (name, vCPU count, memory).
- Start / restart / shutdown / remove existing VMs that you own.
- Update CPU and memory allocation.
- Open a serial console or noVNC session in the browser.
- Download an `.rdp` file (`rdpgw.rdp`) preconfigured for the gateway.

The same `johndoe` / `dogood` credentials are exercised by the LDAP
integration tests, so they are also the recommended local smoke-test account.

## Connecting an RDP client

Use any standard RDP client (mstsc, FreeRDP, Remmina, …) and point it at the
gateway's host on port `443`, with the **server name** set to the SNI value
the gateway expects for your target VM (typically `<vmname>.<FRONT_DOMAIN>`,
for example `myvm.desktop.local.gd`).

The easiest path is to download the `rdpgw.rdp` file from the dashboard — it
already contains the correct hostname and TLS settings.

The gateway requires TLS-protected RDP (`PROTOCOL_SSL`); clients that only
offer the legacy Standard RDP Security will be rejected.

## Configuration

All runtime configuration is read from environment variables and registered in
[`internal/config/config.go`](internal/config/config.go). On start-up the
gateway prints a table of every setting and its effective value.

Booleans accept anything `strconv.ParseBool` recognises (`true`, `false`,
`1`, `0`, `yes`, `no`, …). Durations accept Go's `time.ParseDuration`
syntax (e.g. `15s`, `2m`, `500ms`).

### Disabling clipboard and drive redirection

The gateway can enforce a "no clipboard" and/or "no local drive mapping"
policy on every RDP session it proxies, independently of the client
configuration or the VM-side Group Policy. When enabled, the gateway parses the
client's MCS Connect Initial PDU after the TLS handshake and renames the
`cliprdr` and/or `rdpdr` static virtual channel entries in the CS_NET block to
unused names. The server allocates MCS channel IDs as usual (so the RDP
connection still establishes) but no clipboard or drive redirection service is
ever bound to the renamed channels.

| Environment variable     | Default | Effect                                                                                                                                                          |
|--------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `RDP_DISABLE_CLIPBOARD`  | `false` | When `true`, strip the `cliprdr` virtual channel so clipboard redirection is disabled.                                                                          |
| `RDP_DISABLE_DRIVES`     | `false` | When `true`, strip the `rdpdr` virtual channel so local drive mapping (and other RDPDR redirections such as printers and smart cards over RDPDR) is disabled.   |

### TLS certificates

There are three supported modes for the front-side certificate:

1. **Self-signed (default for local dev).** Leave `CERT_FILE`, `KEY_FILE` and
   `ACME_ENABLE` empty. A self-signed certificate is generated in-memory on
   start.
2. **Static PEM files.** Set `CERT_FILE` and `KEY_FILE` to readable PEM files
   inside the container/process.
3. **ACME.** Set `ACME_ENABLE=true`, set `FRONT_DOMAIN` to the public hostname,
   and set `ACME_EMAIL`. Optionally set `ACME_CA=staging` while testing. ACME
   state is persisted under `$DATA_ROOT_DIR/acme`.

Backend (VM) TLS certificates are intentionally **not** validated — VMs
typically present per-host self-signed certs.

### LDAP

For local development, the bundled `glauth` container is configured in
`testldap/default-config.cfg` and is reachable from the gateway container at
`ldaps://ldap:389`. For production, point `LDAP_URL` at your own directory and
adjust `LDAP_BASE_DN`, `LDAP_USER_FILTER`, and `LDAP_USER_DOMAIN` to match.
Prefer `ldaps://` or `LDAP_STARTTLS=true` and set
`LDAP_SKIP_TLS_VERIFY=false` once your CA chain is trusted.

### Libvirt and VM storage

The dashboard manages VMs through libvirt. The gateway expects:

- A libvirt socket bind-mounted at `/var/run/libvirt` (already wired up in
  `docker-compose.yml`).
- A storage pool named by `VIRT_STORAGE_POOL_NAME` (default `desktop`) backed
  by `$DATA_ROOT_DIR/image` on the host.
- Network reachability from the gateway container to each VM's RDP port over
  the `virbr0` bridge. The compose file attaches the gateway to a macvlan on
  `virbr0` with a fixed address of `192.168.122.254`.

When a VM is created from the dashboard and the configured base image is not
present locally, it is downloaded from `BASE_IMAGE_URL` into
`$DATA_ROOT_DIR/image`.

## Building from source

Requirements:

- Go (see `go.mod` for the minimum version).
- A C toolchain and `libvirt-dev` headers (the binary is built with
  `CGO_ENABLED=1`).
- Node.js + TypeScript 5.x for the dashboard bundle.

Build the dashboard bundle and the binary locally:

```sh
tsc -p tsconfig.json          # compile ui/dashboard.ts → static/dashboard.js
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -o remotegateway
```

Or build the production container image:

```sh
docker compose build
```

The multi-stage `Dockerfile` compiles the TypeScript UI and the Go binary in a
`golang:1.25-alpine` builder and ships only the resulting binary plus
`libvirt-libs` and `ca-certificates` in the runtime image.

### UI (TypeScript)

The dashboard UI source lives in `ui/dashboard.ts`. Rebuild the embedded asset
with:

```sh
tsc -p tsconfig.json
```

The compiled output is `static/dashboard.js` and is embedded into the binary
via Go's `embed` package.

## Testing and linting

```sh
make test     # go test ./... with coverage; writes coverage.out and coverage.html
make lint     # run golangci-lint
make gosec    # run gosec security scanner
go test -race ./...
```

Some integration tests (e.g. `ldap_integration_test.go`,
`dashboard_vm_integration_test.go`) start temporary services via
`testcontainers-go`, so Docker needs to be available locally to run them.

- Backend TLS verification is disabled by design (VMs typically use self-signed
  certs). Treat the network between the gateway and its VMs as trusted.
- All environment-backed parameters must be defined in
  `internal/config/config.go`. Reading `os.Getenv` directly from feature code
  is not allowed and is enforced by `make lint`.
- The gateway listens on `:443` only. There is no plaintext HTTP listener.
